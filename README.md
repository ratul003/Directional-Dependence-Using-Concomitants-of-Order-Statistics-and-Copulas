#### Directional-Dependence-Using-Concomitants-of-Order-Statistics-and-Copulas

Demonstrated order statistics and concomitants of order statistics to determine the directional dependence between two variables by constructing a sample algorithm and implementing that on copulas. The data was randomly generated using Monte Carlo Simulation to avoid causal biases.
